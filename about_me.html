      <p>My name is Chenniya Thompson and I am a 15 year old. I enjoy dancing, drawing and hanging out with my friends every weekend. I'm an 11th grader who attends Miami Lakes Educational Center. I am a very busy person and my week is always full. My extra curricular include dancing, First Priority, Key Club, NAACP, and Debutante. I enjoy being with children and being a role model towards them and that is why I am in Early Childhood Education. </p>
